## Synopsis

I am collecting my answers to code challenges in JavaScript here. These are taken from sources like CoderByte, FreeCodeCamp, and HackerRank.

## Code Example

All of the files are separate bits of code, usually wrapped inside a function. The functions will return the answer to the challenge question.

## Motivation

I wanted to document my progress as I work through these challenges in one place. It is also good to keep solutions handy in case I need to use one of these functions in a bigger program.
